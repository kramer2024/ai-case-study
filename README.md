### Case Study - AI research

![alt text](image.png)

## Overview and Origin

For many years the world operated on paper documents having to be physically signed and read to ensure completion and accuracy of data input. The recent trend in the world has been to move ever closer to a 'paperless' environment yet there is still so much real paper still in existence and in process of being transferred into digital content. Many companies have helped in the digitization of documents to make content available in an easier to reach fashion for broader consumption for users. With this digital transformation has come a company started in 2015 by a student in an MIT PhD program. Anant Bhardwaj started Instabase Inc after getting guidance from his mentors at MIT to pursue different research projects. He then decided to drop out of the PhD program and pursue his passion for enabling business and process automation for consuming and enabling easy access to digital documents and unstructured data. Starting a company that did not exist previously requires the help of many people and ultimately **investors**! *The company started off with initial funding of $3.75m raised in 2015 with another $105m raised in a Series B during 2019 then most recently another $45m in Series C raised in 2023.* They have been and continue to be supported by multiple Ventura Capital companies that help generate the funding required to continue to research and improve their product. 

## Business Activities

Anant started with his focus on solving the systemic 'problem' of having paper documents that were not easy to consume or summarize quickly. He identified he would be able to create a platform and process that would allow ingestion of unstructured data and documents that would permit users to easily search and summarize content quickly, reducing many human hours and errors in potentially reading very large documents for specific information. 

Instabase is currently focused on enterprise  customers in building their base implementations and product releases. They have lead into the market place by solving the common issue of having too much data and not having access or understanding of what to do with it. Instabase believes their market advantage comes from the ability to deliver solutions quickly with AI platforms that are emerging and constantly changing. They have built additional functional tool to provide workflow automation and repeatable process management that also allows the customer to take and adjust as their needs change. 

While Instabase is a very young organization they have carved out a space to help them continue to deliver customer value going forward. They have built a platform to consume unstructured data that includes transformer-based layout-aware language models combined with the power of GPT-4. They have combined a user friendly AI Hub that gives users access to read and summarize data, build and modify workflows with a built in app-store that comes with pre-built apps and will eventually support open market contributions to continue to grow the company presence and utilization. 

## Landscape

Instabase started at what looks to be the right time in the right space in the market for Intelligent Document Processing(IDP). They have several patents created in the 'Computing/Calculating' category supporting their software package now being made available to apply latest AI innovations to understand unstructured data elements and help solve complex business problems for large corporations.  

There have been many technological breakthroughs over the last century that has helped drive people and companies alike to join the race to learn. Machine Learning and AI have been part of the recent market changes that has really influenced the technology world and causing many to re-focus and see what else can now be accomplished. 
The concept of Data Democratization combined with AI techniques has made this segment of technology jump ahead quickly. Organizations are learning how to use classic data science in a modern way with new tools enabling more companies to realize investing in understanding their own data is imperative to continued success and growth. Cloud based data analytics continues to push the edge when it comes to data processing and gaining insights into 'hidden' elements that were previously difficult to uncover and understand. Empowering more people without data science backgrounds to understand more with the help of computers. 

The specific field Instabase competes in is crowded with startups and large existing enterprise competitors. Companies like Oracle, Adobe, Microsoft, Amazon and Google are among a few of the larger companies vying for market share in this space. Not only are the big well-known companies pursuing automation and document processing there are quite a few smaller organizations involved like Hyperscience, Ocrulus, Rossum, Hypatos. 

## Results

Instabase has started to disrupt the technology world with their modern approach to automation and has begun to show results in the different fields they have penetration in currently. Their product and process improvements are guiding the way for improved efficiencies and enabling humans to have more time to take on different tasks. 
> - In the Financial Services industry they are showing how their automation suite improves onboarding and can facilitate faster decision making and risk mitigation for loan originations. 
>  - Their work in the Insurance industry is helping to process claims faster with less human touch, which reduces potential errors or delays in customer satisfaction.  
>  - They have been working with the Federal Government which has led to a 78% reduction in processing time for simple tax documents. 

Instabase must be able to hold their product and execution accountable for the accuracy of the document processing and results produced from using their tools. While they are considered one of the market leaders in this space they will have to continue to refine their own work to ensure their processing exceeds that of their competitors. Instabase has shown how important accuracy is document processing is with their Accuracy metrics reports. This focuses in on processing times compared to previous execution runs with same datasets and represents the opportunity to refine and improve times ongoing. Included with these reports is the ability to compare to a baseline(ground truth set) which provides insights into accuracy of data read and processing. 

## Recommendations

If the day comes where Instabase were to reach out to me and inquire about what I could suggest for them to improve their market share or business model I would not have a lot of specific input. My research has shown they have a very viable product offering and continue to improve the technology supporting their approach. I do believe since they are still a very young company and currently focused on enterprise clients - many with difficult regulatory requirements, they will absolutely have the opportunity to expand beyond this footprint. 

- Develop a native mobile application version of their document processing tools
    - Currently users are directed to a web platform for use
    - Utilizing all the different mobile device platforms to empower end users
- Market to individual end users to expand the breadth of their application coverage
    - Since their current focus is Enterprise they are missing out on a large population of people who could benefit from this technology at home
    - This would require modifications to their current business model and marketing plans

I would suspect as Instabase continues to expand and stabilize their Enterprise footprint while refining their product offering I could see how they can easily make the transition into mass consumer markets. I feel it would be an important step as our world continues to evolve to a more digital society this type of tool could benefit all people in their daily lives.
