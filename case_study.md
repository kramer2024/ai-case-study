## Overview and Origin

For many years the world operated on paper documents having to be physically signed and read to ensure completion and accuracy of data input. The recent trend in the world has been to move ever closer to a 'paperless' environment yet there is still so much real paper still in existence and in process of being transferred into digital content. Many companies have helped in the digitization of documents to make content availible in an easier to reach fashion for broader consumption for users. With this digital transformation has come a company started in 2015 by a student in an MIT PhD program. Anant Bhardwaj started Instabase Inc after getting guidance from his mentors at MIT to pursue different research projects. He then decided to drop out of the PhD program and pursue his passion for enabling business and process automation
